# Adaptive-Denoising-of-DOA-and-Beamformer-Design

This is a refined version of the project **DOA-Denoising-and-Beamformer-Design**.
Where the denoising part, done by Hilbert Haung transfrom which in fact did not realize the spirit of adaptive filtering, is replace with a more appropriate method.
The method combines linear predection and the least mean square algorithm.
